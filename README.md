# .CVS-and-Excel-Conversion-Software

Company background: A local company has a machine that recieves their products and produces a data file the inventory items it recieves. The populated list is then required to be uploaded to their online store. Issues with the formats and structure are to be corrected. At present before the software was implemented. The restrucure of the files had to be done by employee's. The name the company is The HUB TCG located in Gilroy CA.

This is a software program that was created for a local shop with the intention to transform the data output recieved by an inventoring machine that then produces a .csv file format with unstructed data from the inventory items recieved. 

The data is then structured to meet the requirements required by the online store. 

C# is used in this project to create a GUI and implement functions and methods to allow the employee's to easily upload the files required to restructure the data. 

Python is utilized to convert the the data between the .csv from the machine and the .xlsx file from the online data base. A new .xlsx file is created with the Primary key's in the .csv and matched to the .xlsx database to create the new .xlsx to have the invetory items in the structure and format required for the online store. 

This in turn has reduced the requirements of employee work load by an estimate of 25%. Many employee's would spend hours attempting to correct the unsturcted data.
